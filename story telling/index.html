        Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for
        a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked
        and, when no one answered, she walked right in. At the table in the
        kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She
        tasted the porridge from the first bowl.
